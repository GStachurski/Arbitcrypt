### ArbitCrypt ###

* Pulls prices from the Bittrex and Binance exchanges, highlights arbitrage opportunities between them.
* Given the amount of ETH or BTC you have to trade, estimates potential profit.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Fork or pull latest from master, build and run.
* I typically run it from powershell in case something blows up I can restart with all the same commands.

### Special Notes ###

* There is absolutely no validation, any invalid input will crash it.
* Always check the wallet status (on both exchanges) if a pair has an abnormally high arbitrage opportunity.
